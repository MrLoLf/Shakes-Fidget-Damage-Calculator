# Shakes-and-Fidget-Damage-Calculator

The calculator can calculate the damage for every class, except for the assasins. 
The calculator is not 100% correct because values could be rounded differently by Shakes & Fidget.
You have to have python installed because the calculator was programmed in python. You can download python from https://www.python.org/.

# Use 
- Make sure you have Python correctly installed.
- Double click the downloaded .py file and enter your details. If you don't have any values to enter somewhere, enter 0. Dont forget to add the gems values on your normal values.
- Press ENTER to exit.
